# Easy Chef Website Project - Phase 1 (Static HTML + TailWind CSS )

https://samirghias.github.io/EasyChef/pages/index.html

For phase 1 of my CSC309 project, We were tasked to implement most of the HTML/CSS of the projects front facing platform. Our deliverable for this phase was a static demo of Easy Chef. Our codes were only allowed to consist of HTML and CSS files, without any backend/frontend servers. We were not supposed to implement any JS logic at this phase, except for JS files that are imported from external sources. Forms and buttons do not send any request, but the links point to various pages included in the application.

Using a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Semantic, Bulma) was strongly recommended so the styling was implemented with Tailwind CSS. We were allowed to use online templates to consolidate your design. However, since it is a static website at this stage, we could not use any frontend framework, including any React-dependent CSS framework.

The detailed structure or the exact number of pages was up to us. However, the website needed to be navigable. That is, different pages should be connected to each other through clickable links and buttons. The general structure follows:

# Requirements Given for Phase 1:
- All pages should have a navbar that includes relevant information such as links to home, my recipes, a button for creating new recipes, and a - dropdown that shows the user's profile and includes a link to the shopping list, edit profile, and logout.
- The detailed content of the home page is up to you. Generally, a search bar and filter options as well as a list of popular recipes are expected to be on that page.
- Recipes displayed in lists (e.g., search results) must be displayed in cards. Cards must contain useful information about the recipe, such as name, at least one photo, and cooking time. They are clickable and point to the recipe details page.
- You should also provide the static version of the 'recipe details' page, as well as the recipe creation form. The recipe page should be comprehensive and include whatever is relevant data about that recipe. The detailed design of that page (e.g., using tabs) is up to you. You can assume that we only enter one step for creating recipes, given that supporting more steps in a beautiful way might need some JS logic.
- You should include an example 'my recipes' page, as well as a shopping list page consisting of multiple recipes.
- You should include an example 'edit profile' form as well. You do not need to provide one for login/signup assuming that those forms will be very similar.

# Notes and Team: 
This website was only made to be tested on desktop monitors, but the actual screen size could vary. So it was our responsibility to make sure that the application renders well on various desktop screen sizes.
